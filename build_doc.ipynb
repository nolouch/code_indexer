       "   'content': '## Defining A Message Type {#simple}\\n\\nFirst let\\'s look at a very simple example. Let\\'s say you want to define a search\\nrequest message format, where each search request has a query string, the\\nparticular page of results you are interested in, and a number of results per\\npage. Here\\'s the `.proto` file you use to define the message type.\\n\\n```proto\\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\\n\\nmessage SearchRequest {\\n  string query = 1;\\n  int32 page_number = 2;\\n  int32 results_per_page = 3;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*   The first line of the file specifies that you\\'re using the proto3 revision\\n    of the protobuf language spec.\\n\\n    *   The `edition` (or `syntax` for proto2/proto3) must be the first\\n        non-empty, non-comment line of the file.\\n    *   If no `edition` or `syntax` is specified, the protocol buffer compiler\\n        will assume you are using\\n        [proto2](/programming-guides/proto2).\\n\\n*   The `SearchRequest` message definition specifies three fields (name/value\\n    pairs), one for each piece of data that you want to include in this type of\\n    message. Each field has a name and a type.\\n\\n### Specifying Field Types {#specifying-types}\\n\\nIn the earlier example, all the fields are [scalar types](#scalar): two integers\\n(`page_number` and `results_per_page`) and a string (`query`). You can also\\nspecify [enumerations](#enum) and composite types like other message types for\\nyour field.\\n\\n### Assigning Field Numbers {#assigning}\\n\\nYou must give each field in your message definition a number between `1` and\\n`536,870,911` with the following restrictions:\\n\\n-   The given number **must be unique** among all fields for that message.\\n-   Field numbers `19,000` to `19,999` are reserved for the Protocol Buffers\\n    implementation. The protocol buffer compiler will complain if you use one of\\n    these reserved field numbers in your message.\\n-   You cannot use any previously [reserved](#fieldreserved) field numbers or\\n    any field numbers that have been allocated to\\n    [extensions](/programming-guides/proto2#extensions).\\n\\nThis number **cannot be changed once your message type is in use** because it\\nidentifies the field in the\\n[message wire format](/programming-guides/encoding).\\n\"Changing\" a field number is equivalent to deleting that field and creating a\\nnew field with the same type but a new number. See [Deleting Fields](#deleting)\\nfor how to do this properly.\\n\\nField numbers **should never be reused**. Never take a field number out of the\\n[reserved](#fieldreserved) list for reuse with a new field definition. See\\n[Consequences of Reusing Field Numbers](#consequences).\\n\\nYou should use the field numbers 1 through 15 for the most-frequently-set\\nfields. Lower field number values take less space in the wire format. For\\nexample, field numbers in the range 1 through 15 take one byte to encode. Field\\nnumbers in the range 16 through 2047 take two bytes. You can find out more about\\nthis in\\n[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding#structure).\\n\\n#### Consequences of Reusing Field Numbers {#consequences}\\n\\nReusing a field number makes decoding wire-format messages ambiguous.\\n\\nThe protobuf wire format is lean and doesn\\'t provide a way to detect fields\\nencoded using one definition and decoded using another.\\n\\nEncoding a field using one definition and then decoding that same field with a\\ndifferent definition can lead to:\\n\\n-   Developer time lost to debugging\\n-   A parse/merge error (best case scenario)\\n-   Leaked PII/SPII\\n-   Data corruption\\n\\nCommon causes of field number reuse:\\n\\n-   renumbering fields (sometimes done to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing\\n    number order for fields). Renumbering effectively deletes and re-adds all\\n    the fields involved in the renumbering, resulting in incompatible\\n    wire-format changes.\\n-   deleting a field and not [reserving](#fieldreserved) the number to prevent\\n    future reuse.\\n\\nThe field number is limited to 29 bits rather than 32 bits because three bits\\nare used to specify the field\\'s wire format. For more on this, see the\\n[Encoding topic](/programming-guides/encoding#structure).\\n\\n<a id=\"specifying-field-rules\"></a>\\n\\n### Specifying Field Cardinality {#field-labels}\\n\\nMessage fields can be one of the following:\\n\\n*   *Singular*:\\n\\n    In proto3, there are two types of singular fields:\\n\\n    *   `optional`: (recommended) An `optional` field is in one of two possible\\n        states:\\n\\n        *   the field is set, and contains a value that was explicitly set or\\n            parsed from the wire. It will be serialized to the wire.\\n        *   the field is unset, and will return the default value. It will not\\n            be serialized to the wire.\\n\\n        You can check to see if the value was explicitly set.\\n\\n        `optional` is recommended over *implicit* fields for maximum\\n        compatibility with protobuf editions and proto2.\\n\\n    *   *implicit*: (not recommended) An implicit field has no explicit\\n        cardinality label and behaves as follows:\\n\\n        *   if the field is a message type, it behaves just like an `optional`\\n            field.\\n        *   if the field is not a message, it has two states:\\n\\n            *   the field is set to a non-default (non-zero) value that was\\n                explicitly set or parsed from the wire. It will be serialized to\\n                the wire.\\n            *   the field is set to the default (zero) value. It will not be\\n                serialized to the wire. In fact, you cannot determine whether\\n                the default (zero) value was set or parsed from the wire or not\\n                provided at all. For more on this subject, see\\n                [Field Presence](/programming-guides/field_presence).\\n\\n*   `repeated`: this field type can be repeated zero or more times in a\\n    well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.\\n\\n*   `map`: this is a paired key/value field type. See\\n    [Maps](/programming-guides/encoding#maps) for more on\\n    this field type.\\n\\n#### Repeated Fields are Packed by Default {#use-packed}\\n\\nIn proto3, `repeated` fields of scalar numeric types use `packed` encoding by\\ndefault.\\n\\nYou can find out more about `packed` encoding in\\n[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding#packed).\\n\\n#### Message Type Fields Always Have Field Presence {#field-presence}\\n\\nIn proto3, message-type fields already have field presence. Because of this,\\nadding the `optional` modifier doesn\\'t change the field presence for the field.\\n\\nThe definitions for `Message2` and `Message3` in the following code sample\\ngenerate the same code for all languages, and there is no difference in\\nrepresentation in binary, JSON, and TextFormat:\\n\\n```proto\\nsyntax=\"proto3\";\\n\\npackage foo.bar;\\n\\nmessage Message1 {}\\n\\nmessage Message2 {\\n  Message1 foo = 1;\\n}\\n\\nmessage Message3 {\\n  optional Message1 bar = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Well-formed Messages {#well-formed}\\n\\nThe term \"well-formed,\" when applied to protobuf messages, refers to the bytes\\nserialized/deserialized. The protoc parser validates that a given proto\\ndefinition file is parseable.\\n\\nSingular fields can appear more than once in wire-format bytes. The parser will\\naccept the input, but only the last instance of that field will be accessible\\nthrough the generated bindings. See\\n[Last One Wins](/programming-guides/encoding#last-one-wins)\\nfor more on this topic.\\n\\n### Adding More Message Types {#adding-types}\\n\\nMultiple message types can be defined in a single `.proto` file. This is useful\\nif you are defining multiple related messages – so, for example, if you wanted\\nto define the reply message format that corresponds to your `SearchResponse`\\nmessage type, you could add it to the same `.proto`:\\n\\n```proto\\nmessage SearchRequest {\\n  string query = 1;\\n  int32 page_number = 2;\\n  int32 results_per_page = 3;\\n}\\n\\nmessage SearchResponse {\\n ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Combining Messages leads to bloat** While multiple message types (such as\\nmessage, enum, and service) can be defined in a single `.proto` file, it can\\nalso lead to dependency bloat when large numbers of messages with varying\\ndependencies are defined in a single file. It\\'s recommended to include as few\\nmessage types per `.proto` file as possible.\\n\\n### Adding Comments {#adding-comments}\\n\\nTo add comments to your `.proto` files:\\n\\n*   Prefer C/C++/Java line-end-style comments \\'//\\' on the line before the .proto\\n    code element\\n*   C-style inline/multi-line comments `/* ... */` are also accepted.\\n\\n    *   When using multi-line comments, a margin line of \\'*\\' is preferred.\\n\\n```proto\\n/**\\n * SearchRequest represents a search query, with pagination options to\\n * indicate which results to include in the response.\\n */\\nmessage SearchRequest {\\n  string query = 1;\\n\\n  // Which page number do we want?\\n  int32 page_number = 2;\\n\\n  // Number of results to return per page.\\n  int32 results_per_page = 3;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Deleting Fields {#deleting}\\n\\nDeleting fields can cause serious problems if not done properly.\\n\\nWhen you no longer need a field and all references have been deleted from client\\ncode, you may delete the field definition from the message. However, you\\n**must** [reserve the deleted field number](#fieldreserved). If you do not\\nreserve the field number, it is possible for a developer to reuse that number in\\nthe future.\\n\\nYou should also reserve the field name to allow JSON and TextFormat encodings of\\nyour message to continue to parse.\\n\\n<a id=\"fieldreserved\"></a>\\n\\n#### Reserved Field Numbers {#reserved-field-numbers}\\n\\nIf you [update](#updating) a message type by entirely deleting a field, or\\ncommenting it out, future developers can reuse the field number when making\\ntheir own updates to the type. This can cause severe issues, as described in\\n[Consequences of Reusing Field Numbers](#consequences). To make sure this\\ndoesn\\'t happen, add your deleted field number to the `reserved` list.\\n\\nThe protoc compiler will generate error messages if any future developers try to\\nuse these reserved field numbers.\\n\\n```proto\\nmessage Foo {\\n  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nReserved field number ranges are inclusive (`9 to 11` is the same as `9, 10,\\n11`).\\n\\n#### Reserved Field Names {#reserved-field-names}\\n\\nReusing an old field name later is generally safe, except when using TextProto\\nor JSON encodings where the field name is serialized. To avoid this risk, you\\ncan add the deleted field name to the `reserved` list.\\n\\nReserved names affect only the protoc compiler behavior and not runtime\\nbehavior, with one exception: TextProto implementations may discard unknown\\nfields (without raising an error like with other unknown fields) with reserved\\nnames at parse time (only the C++ and Go implementations do so today). Runtime\\nJSON parsing is not affected by reserved names.\\n\\n```proto\\nmessage Foo {\\n  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11;\\n  reserved \"foo\", \"bar\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote that you can\\'t mix field names and field numbers in the same `reserved`\\nstatement.\\n\\n### What\\'s Generated from Your `.proto`? {#generated}\\n\\nWhen you run the [protocol buffer compiler](#generating) on a `.proto`, the\\ncompiler generates the code in your chosen language you\\'ll need to work with the\\nmessage types you\\'ve described in the file, including getting and setting field\\nvalues, serializing your messages to an output stream, and parsing your messages\\nfrom an input stream.\\n\\n*   For **C++**, the compiler generates a `.h` and `.cc` file from each\\n    `.proto`, with a class for each message type described in your file.\\n*   For **Java**, the compiler generates a `.java` file with a class for each\\n    message type, as well as a special `Builder` class for creating message\\n    class instances.\\n*   For **Kotlin**, in addition to the Java generated code, the compiler\\n    generates a `.kt` file for each message type with an improved Kotlin API.\\n    This includes a DSL that simplifies creating message instances, a nullable\\n    field accessor, and a copy function.\\n*   **Python** is a little different — the Python compiler generates a module\\n    with a static descriptor of each message type in your `.proto`, which is\\n    then used with a *metaclass* to create the necessary Python data access\\n    class at runtime.\\n*   For **Go**, the compiler generates a `.pb.go` file with a type for each\\n    message type in your file.\\n*   For **Ruby**, the compiler generates a `.rb` file with a Ruby module\\n    containing your message types.\\n*   For **Objective-C**, the compiler generates a `pbobjc.h` and `pbobjc.m` file\\n    from each `.proto`, with a class for each message type described in your\\n    file.\\n*   For **C#**, the compiler generates a `.cs` file from each `.proto`, with a\\n    class for each message type described in your file.\\n*   For **PHP**, the compiler generates a `.php` message file for each message\\n    type described in your file, and a `.php` metadata file for each `.proto`\\n    file you compile. The metadata file is used to load the valid message types\\n    into the descriptor pool.\\n*   For **Dart**, the compiler generates a `.pb.dart` file with a class for each\\n    message type in your file.\\n\\nYou can find out more about using the APIs for each language by following the\\ntutorial for your chosen language.

Each field has a name and a type.\\n\\n### Specifying Field Types {#specifying-types}\\n\\nIn the earlier example, all the fields are [scalar types](#scalar): two integers\\n(`page_number` and `results_per_page`) and a string (`query`). You can also\\nspecify [enumerations](#enum) and composite types like other message types for\\nyour field.\\n\\n### Assigning Field Numbers {#assigning}\\n\\nYou must give each field in your message definition a number between `1` and\\n`536,870,911` with the following restrictions:\\n\\n-   The given number **must be unique** among all fields for that message.\\n-   Field numbers `19,000` to `19,999` are reserved for the Protocol Buffers\\n    implementation. The protocol buffer compiler will complain if you use one of\\n    these reserved field numbers in your message.\\n-   You cannot use any previously [reserved](#fieldreserved) field numbers or\\n    any field numbers that have been allocated to\\n    [extensions](/programming-guides/proto2#extensions).\\n\\nThis number **cannot be changed once your message type is in use** because it\\nidentifies the field in the\\n[message wire format](/programming-guides/encoding).\\n\"Changing\" a field number is equivalent to deleting that field and creating a\\nnew field with the same type but a new number. See [Deleting Fields](#deleting)\\nfor how to do this properly.\\n\\nField numbers **should never be reused**. Never take a field number out of the\\n[reserved](#fieldreserved) list for reuse with a new field definition. See\\n[Consequences of Reusing Field Numbers](#consequences).\\n\\nYou should use the field numbers 1 through 15 for the most-frequently-set\\nfields. Lower field number values take less space in the wire format. For\\nexample, field numbers in the range 1 through 15 take one byte to encode. Field\\nnumbers in the range 16 through 2047 take two bytes. You can find out more about\\nthis in\\n[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding#structure).\\n\\n#### Consequences of Reusing Field Numbers {#consequences}\\n\\nReusing a field number makes decoding wire-format messages ambiguous.\\n\\nThe protobuf wire format is lean and doesn\\'t provide a way to detect fields\\nencoded using one definition and decoded using another.\\n\\nEncoding a field using one definition and then decoding that same field with a\\ndifferent definition can lead to:\\n\\n-   Developer time lost to debugging\\n-   A parse/merge error (best case scenario)\\n-   Leaked PII/SPII\\n-   Data corruption\\n\\nCommon causes of field number reuse:\\n\\n-   renumbering fields (sometimes done to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing\\n    number order for fields). Renumbering effectively deletes and re-adds all\\n    the fields involved in the renumbering, resulting in incompatible\\n    wire-format changes.\\n-   deleting a field and not [reserving](#fieldreserved) the number to prevent\\n    future reuse.\\n\\nThe field number is limited to 29 bits rather than 32 bits because three bits\\nare used to specify the field\\'s wire format. For more on this, see the\\n[Encoding topic](/programming-guides/encoding#structure).\\n\\n<a id=\"specifying-field-rules\"></a>\\n\\n### Specifying Field Cardinality {#field-labels}\\n\\nMessage fields can be one of the following:\\n\\n*   *Singular*:\\n\\n    In proto3, there are two types of singular fields:\\n\\n    *   `optional`: (recommended) An `optional` field is in one of two possible\\n        states:\\n\\n        *   the field is set, and contains a value that was explicitly set or\\n            parsed from the wire. It will be serialized to the wire.\\n        *   the field is unset, and will return the default value. It will not\\n            be serialized to the wire.\\n\\n        You can check to see if the value was explicitly set.\\n\\n        `optional` is recommended over *implicit* fields for maximum\\n        compatibility with protobuf editions and proto2.\\n\\n    *   *implicit*: (not recommended) An implicit field has no explicit\\n        cardinality label and behaves as follows:\\n\\n        *   if the field is a message type, it behaves just like an `optional`\\n            field.\\n        *   if the field is not a message, it has two states:\\n\\n            *   the field is set to a non-default (non-zero) value that was\\n                explicitly set or parsed from the wire. It will be serialized to\\n                the wire.\\n            *   the field is set to the default (zero) value. It will not be\\n                serialized to the wire. In fact, you cannot determine whether\\n                the default (zero) value was set or parsed from the wire or not\\n                provided at all. For more on this subject, see\\n                [Field Presence](/programming-guides/field_presence).\\n\\n*   `repeated`: this field type can be repeated zero or more times in a\\n    well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.\\n\\n*   `map`: this is a paired key/value field type. See\\n    [Maps](/programming-guides/encoding#maps) for more on\\n    this field type.\\n\\n#### Repeated Fields are Packed by Default {#use-packed}\\n\\nIn proto3, `repeated` fields of scalar numeric types use `packed` encoding by\\ndefault.\\n\\nYou can find out more about `packed` encoding in\\n[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding#packed).\\n\\n#### Message Type Fields Always Have Field Presence {#field-presence}\\n\\nIn proto3, message-type fields already have field presence. Because of this,\\nadding the `optional` modifier doesn\\'t change the field presence for the field.\\n\\nThe definitions for `Message2` and `Message3` in the following code sample\\ngenerate the same code for all languages, and there is no difference in\\nrepresentation in binary, JSON, and TextFormat:\\n\\n```proto\\nsyntax=\"proto3\";\\n\\npackage foo.bar;\\n\\nmessage Message1 {}\\n\\nmessage Message2 {\\n  Message1 foo = 1;\\n}\\n\\nmessage Message3 {\\n  optional Message1 bar = 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Well-formed Messages {#well-formed}\\n\\nThe term \"well-formed,\" when applied to protobuf messages, refers to the bytes\\nserialized/deserialized. The protoc parser validates that a given proto\\ndefinition file is parseable.\\n\\nSingular fields can appear more than once in wire-format bytes. The parser will\\naccept the input, but only the last instance of that field will be accessible\\nthrough the generated bindings. See\\n[Last One Wins](/programming-guides/encoding#last-one-wins)\\nfor more on this topic.\\n\\n### Adding More Message Types {#adding-types}\\n\\nMultiple message types can be defined in a single `.proto` file. This is useful\\nif you are defining multiple related messages – so, for example, if you wanted\\nto define the reply message format that corresponds to your `SearchResponse`\\nmessage type, you could add it to the same `.proto`:\\n\\n```proto\\nmessage SearchRequest {\\n  string query = 1;\\n  int32 page_number = 2;\\n  int32 results_per_page = 3;\\n}\\n\\nmessage SearchResponse {\\n ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Combining Messages leads to bloat** While multiple message types (such as\\nmessage, enum, and service) can be defined in a single `.proto` file, it can\\nalso lead to dependency bloat when large numbers of messages with varying\\ndependencies are defined in a single file. It\\'s recommended to include as few\\nmessage types per `.proto` file as possible.\\n\\n### Adding Comments {#adding-comments}\\n\\nTo add comments to your `.proto` files:\\n\\n*   Prefer C/C++/Java line-end-style comments \\'//\\' on the line before the .proto\\n    code element\\n*   C-style inline/multi-line comments `/* ... */` are also accepted.\\n\\n    *   When using multi-line comments, a margin line of \\'*\\' is preferred.\\n\\n```proto\\n/**\\n * SearchRequest represents a search query, with pagination options to\\n * indicate which results to include in the response.\\n */\\nmessage SearchRequest {\\n  string query = 1;\\n\\n  // Which page number do we want?\\n  int32 page_number = 2;\\n\\n  // Number of results to return per page.\\n  int32 results_per_page = 3;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Deleting Fields {#deleting}\\n\\nDeleting fields can cause serious problems if not done properly.\\n\\nWhen you no longer need a field and all references have been deleted from client\\ncode, you may delete the field definition from the message. However, you\\n**must** [reserve the deleted field number](#fieldreserved). If you do not\\nreserve the field number, it is possible for a developer to reuse that number in\\nthe future.\\n\\nYou should also reserve the field name to allow JSON and TextFormat encodings of\\nyour message to continue to parse.\\n\\n<a id=\"fieldreserved\"></a>\\n\\n#### Reserved Field Numbers {#reserved-field-numbers}\\n\\nIf you [update](#updating) a message type by entirely deleting a field, or\\ncommenting it out, future developers can reuse the field number when making\\ntheir own updates to the type. This can cause severe issues, as described in\\n[Consequences of Reusing Field Numbers](#consequences). To make sure this\\ndoesn\\'t happen, add your deleted field number to the `reserved` list.\\n\\nThe protoc compiler will generate error messages if any future developers try to\\nuse these reserved field numbers.\\n\\n```proto\\nmessage Foo {\\n  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nReserved field number ranges are inclusive (`9 to 11` is the same as `9, 10,\\n11`).\\n\\n#### Reserved Field Names {#reserved-field-names}\\n\\nReusing an old field name later is generally safe, except when using TextProto\\nor JSON encodings where the field name is serialized. To avoid this risk, you\\ncan add the deleted field name to the `reserved` list.\\n\\nReserved names affect only the protoc compiler behavior and not runtime\\nbehavior, with one exception: TextProto implementations may discard unknown\\nfields (without raising an error like with other unknown fields) with reserved\\nnames at parse time (only the C++ and Go implementations do so today). Runtime\\nJSON parsing is not affected by reserved names.\\n\\n```proto\\nmessage Foo {\\n  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11;\\n  reserved \"foo\", \"bar\";\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote that you can\\'t mix field names and field numbers in the same `reserved`\\nstatement.\\n\\n### What\\'s Generated from Your `.proto`? {#generated}\\n\\nWhen you run the [protocol buffer compiler](#generating) on a `.proto`, the\\ncompiler generates the code in your chosen language you\\'ll need to work with the\\nmessage types you\\'ve described in the file, including getting and setting field\\nvalues, serializing your messages to an output stream, and parsing your messages\\nfrom an input stream.\\n\\n*   For **C++**, the compiler generates a `.h` and `.cc` file from each\\n    `.proto`, with a class for each message type described in your file.\\n*   For **Java**, the compiler generates a `.java` file with a class for each\\n    message type, as well as a special `Builder` class for creating message\\n    class instances.\\n*   For **Kotlin**, in addition to the Java generated code, the compiler\\n    generates a `.kt` file for each message type with an improved Kotlin API.\\n    This includes a DSL that simplifies creating message instances, a nullable\\n    field accessor, and a copy function.\\n*   **Python** is a little different — the Python compiler generates a module\\n    with a static descriptor of each message type in your `.proto`, which is\\n    then used with a *metaclass* to create the necessary Python data access\\n    class at runtime.\\n*   For **Go**, the compiler generates a `.pb.go` file with a type for each\\n    message type in your file.\\n*   For **Ruby**, the compiler generates a `.rb` file with a Ruby module\\n    containing your message types.\\n*   For **Objective-C**, the compiler generates a `pbobjc.h` and `pbobjc.m` file\\n    from each `.proto`, with a class for each message type described in your\\n    file.\\n*   For **C#**, the compiler generates a `.cs` file from each `.proto`, with a\\n    class for each message type described in your file.\\n*   For **PHP**, the compiler generates a `.php` message file for each message\\n    type described in your file, and a `.php` metadata file for each `.proto`\\n    file you compile. The metadata file is used to load the valid message types\\n    into the descriptor pool.\\n*   For **Dart**, the compiler generates a `.pb.dart` file with a class for each\\n    message type in your file.\\n\\nYou can find out more about using the APIs for each language by following the\\ntutorial for your chosen language.
